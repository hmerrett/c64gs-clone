## Case

I bought the case from [https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-print-models/gadgets/pc-laptop/commodore-64-game-system-c64gs-enclosure](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-print-models/gadgets/pc-laptop/commodore-64-game-system-c64gs-enclosure). At the time of writing, it's on offer at $9. Bargain. 

My case was printed by PCBway in [UTR 8360](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/3d-printing/plastic/resin/UTR-8360/) (standard white material) and cost just under $100. 

## PCB

I was very kindly gifted a purple BWACK 250469 replica by jongratton_80838 on the [Retro Hardware Discord](https://discord.gg/DFgQQJgHH8). Thank you buddy! :-)
